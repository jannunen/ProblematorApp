        <dt>How the scoring system works?</dt>
        <dd>Only your 10 hardest routes are included in the ranking. Let's say that your score is 7450. It means that 7450 / 10 = 745. Your average grade is just a little bit below 7a+. If you get 50 points more with a single route, you would achieve a score of 7500 and break the 7b barrier.<br /><br />If your hardest ascent in your top10 is 7b+, three 7bs and the rest are 7as. So you need to replace that easiest 7a with 50 points hardest ascent, which is 7a+.<br /><br />
        And the points go as follows: 6a = 400, 6a+ = 450, 6b = 500, ... 6c+ = 650, 7a = 700, 7b = 800, 7c = 900, 8a = 100.
        </dd>
        <dt>I ticked a problem, it didn't add my score as much as it should, why?</dt>
        <dd>Lead climbs score the normal points. Top ropes score two grades lower (-105pts). This is because top roping is less demanding than lead climbing. So your 7a with a top rope comes just a little shy of 6c. Wanna score higher? Lead the route :) You can select the default ascent type from the settings page.</dd>
        <dt>How do I untick a problem?</dt>
        <dd>The easiest way is to click "MANAGE TICKS..." underneath "SAVE TICK"-button on Problem Details page. Other way is to ro to Tick Archive, select the right date and swipe left on the list.</dd>
        <dt>How do I quick tick a problem?</dt>
        <dd>Go to the Problems-page, swipe left and you can quick tick a problem. Or enter tag (or tags comma separated) to text field on the top of the page.</dd>
